<span>Developed using Databricks with ❤️</span>


The input.txt with tinyshakespear and the base64 encoded string representations + corresponding descriptions are in the inputs.csv file in the images directory.

**The code was entirely developed on Databricks using a single A100 for compute. If you're running this on Databricks, you can scale this on an arbitrarily large GPU cluster with no issues, on the cloud provider of your choice.**

**I chose to use MLFlow (which comes pre-installed in Databricks. It's fully open source and you can pip install easily elsewhere) as I find it helpful to track and log all the metrics necessary. This is entirely optional but encouraged.**

**Please note that the implementation emphasizes readability and hackability vs. performance, so there are many ways in which you could improve this. Please try and let me know!**

Hope you find this useful. Happy hacking!!
